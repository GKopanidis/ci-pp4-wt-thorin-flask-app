        "description": "Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior.This was demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria 's East - gate, and at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet 'Oakenshield,' which remained with him even in death.",
