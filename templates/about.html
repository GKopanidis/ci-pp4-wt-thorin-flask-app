        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
        in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
        Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
        Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
        Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
        action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned
        to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in
                his youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug,
                in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle
                of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's
                East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on
                the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which remained with him even in death.

                Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews of
				Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
				the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            <h3>Óin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was
                Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin.

                Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's
                company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves
                who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin
                were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the
                group. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain
                with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the company of Thorin.

            <h3>Gloin</h3>
            <p>
                Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin
                and younger brother of Óin.

                In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of
                the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.

                In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In
                March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin
                to reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin
                referred them as "simpletons" and also said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling
                distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".

            <h3>Balin</h3>
            <p>
                Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen
                Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
                A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest
                friends and advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble House of Durin.

                He later went to re-establish the Dwarf presence in Moria, but within five years it was overcome once
                more by Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.

                forks"; as well as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described as “decent fellow despite his
                grumbling”. He often wore a red-violet coat while on the Quest for Erebor. He was noted by Thorin to be
                the strongest of the thirteen companions.
